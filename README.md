# OLI2MSI
OLI2MSI is a multisensor dataset for remote sensing imagery super-resolution. The OLI2MSI dataset is composed of Landsat8-OLI
and Sentinel2-MSI images, where OLI images serve as low resolution (LR) images and MSI images are regarded as ground truth 
high resolution HR images. The OLI and MSI data have 10m and 30m ground sample distance (GSD) respectively, which means that 
the dataset has an upscale factor of 3. More details about OLI2MSI can be found in our paper.
